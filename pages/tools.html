                            <p>The first issue of the zine has arrived, and it’s not pulling punches. ImVexd here, bringing you the first call to arms in the fight for digital freedom. We’re kicking things off with a manifesto that lays the foundation for everything we’re about—reclaiming the autonomy that’s been stolen from us, dismantling systems of control, and awakening the masses to the fight ahead. If you’ve been feeling the weight of surveillance, corporate greed, and the slow creep of fascism online, this issue is your first step toward understanding the battle lines.</p>

                            <p>Welcome to the February issue, where we continue to peel back the layers of control and reveal the hidden truths of the digital age. ImVexd here, and this month we’re diving even deeper into the chaos, with a focus on the hijacking of America and the systems pulling the strings behind the curtain. We’ll take you through the reality of this modern world, showing you how to hack the very fabric of what we perceive as real. It’s time to disrupt the narratives that have been built to control us—because reality is just another system waiting to be hacked.</p>
