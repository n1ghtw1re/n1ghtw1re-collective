> _“Some signals can’t be traced. Some voices speak from the void. Some websites… were never meant to be found.”_

Welcome to **N1ghtw1re** — a digital hypersigil, a forgotten node on the edge of the network, a webspace lost between the seams of surveillance and signal decay.

This is the official mirror of the **N1ghtw1re** [Neocities site](https://n1ghtw1re.neocities.org), a retro-anarchist blend of cyberpunk philosophy, DIY privacy tools, digital mysticism, and coded rebellion.

It’s not just a website.  
It’s a warning.  
A tutorial.  
A trapdoor.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

- **Obscured HTML / CSS**: Styled like a lost 90s BBS, designed like a cipher.
- **Hidden Lore**: Easter eggs, broken links, and dead ends that aren't dead at all.
- **Cyberpunk Manifestos**: Reality-bending manifestos on surveillance, AI, freedom, and what it means to truly be “offline.”
- **Fragments of the Hypersigil**: Pieces of a larger ritual—each update is a pulse in the network.
- **Gateway to the BBS**: Some terminals connect deeper. Some don't. The ones that do—good luck.

## 🕳️ Why Does This Exist?

N1ghtw1re is a resistance transmission wrapped in an aesthetic skin. It's a living ARG, a multimedia spell, a toolkit for those slipping between cracks in the datastream. It’s for:

- 🛠 Hackers  
- 📜 Occultists  
- 🕶 Anons  
- 🧘‍♂️ Seekers  
- 💀 Ghosts in the machine

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This site is **actively evolving**. Each commit may shift the signal. Contributions aren't currently open—this is a one-way broadcast.

But... if you’ve found something you weren’t supposed to—  
if you've decrypted something no one else has seen—  
you know what to do.
